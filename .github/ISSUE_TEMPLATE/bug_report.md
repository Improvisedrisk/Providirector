**Describe the bug briefly**
When attempting to set Player 2 as director, the mod returns the message "sent director requst to (player name)"
but instead of following that message with "director response OK, set to (player name)", there is no response.

This could be the Player 2's issue because when Player 2 hosts, he is unable to set anyone, him or I as director.

**Suggestions**
Add any other context about the problem here.

the mod list is only what is required at download.

I find it likely that it is a bug relevant only to Player 2, because of how his game files and mod files have interacted in the past. 
Alternatively it could be his username specifically? But I'm not sure if the mod accounts for special characters.
Either way I thought it would be easiest to ask the dev about the issue instead of endlessly trying to solve the issue myself.

Thank you for your time.
