### Providirector
A funky mod for Risk of Rain 2 which allows you to assume the role of a combat director in multiplayer games (kind of)!

Spawn enemies to destroy the survivors, upgrade enemies to stronger Elite variants, and use your Burst buff to keep the survivors on their toes! I made this mainly as a joke after playing too much Battle Cats and Risk of Rain 2.

The mod is server-side only, which means that only the host of the game needs to have the mod installed and enabled. However, if your friends also have the mod installed, you can set them as the director by typing `% [player name]` or `% [player index (number)]` in the pregame lobby, while still remaining as the host!

Due to the nature of the mod, there are likely to be compatiability issues with various mods; even without other mods, buggy behaviour is always on the table thanks to how many moving parts there are. If you have any suggestions or bug reports for the mod, visit the mod's Github page and create an issue! Alternatively, you can shoot me a DM on Discord; my username is `ikesicle`.

## Credits
Thanks to Punished "Venom" Analyst for giving me the initial kickstart to develop this mod. A big thank you to Klehrik for assisting with multiplayer testing. Finally, thanks for the patience and support of everyone who submitted a bug report or gave feedback through Discord - your help is truly invaluable, and I could not have made this without your help.
