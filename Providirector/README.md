### Providirector
A funky mod for Risk of Rain 2 which allows you to assume the role of a combat director in multiplayer games (kind of)!

Spawn enemies to destroy the survivors, upgrade enemies to stronger Elite variants, and use your Burst buff to keep the survivors on their toes!

This mod is still very underdeveloped, and as such is pretty unbalanced, and is still missing a lot of monster icons and polish - **and is FILLED with bugs and compat issues with other mods**. I made this mainly as a joke after playing too much Battle Cats and Risk of Rain 2.

The mod is server-side, which means that only the host of the game needs to have the mod installed and enabled. Other clients can even run vanilla and still play, provided that no content mods are enabled.

If you have any suggestions or bug reports for the mod, visit the mod's Github page and create an issue! Alternatively, you can shoot me a DM on Discord; my username is `ikesicle`.

## Controls
These aren't documented very well in the actual game (there's no tutorial or keybind screen yet) so here are the controls for the Director player.
- Move the mouse to pivot the camera around the current target.
- To check spawnable enemies, hit **Tab** and hover over the monster icons.
- **Scroll Wheel**: Zoom In/Out. **This affects spawn distance for enemies which you spawn.**
- **LMB / RMB**: Next / Previous spectator target
- **Alphanumeric 1 .. 6** (not keypad): Spawn enemy in slot.
- **Space**: Swap currently active page to access more enemies to spawn.
- **C**: While held, you will spawn Tier 1 Elite enemies. (Blazing, Glacial, Overloading)
- **V**: While held, you will spawn Tier 2 Elite enemies. (Malachite, Celestial)
- **F**: Tap to direct all spawned enemies to attack the target you're currently spectating.
- **B**: Burst. Once your meter is full, use this to temporarily buff all currently spawned enemies.
